## API

I will be using FBI Crime API with my .gov API key. https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/api

## MVP

I would like for the user to be able to pull information about general crime statistics for each year in any given US state.

## Post-MVP

Add more statistics. Make the user able to look up crime stats for more specific neighborhoods. Make the buttons and dropdown menus more intuitive.
